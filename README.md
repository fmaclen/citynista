# Citynista

### A city-building tool protoype

---

### Project philosophy

_(if you can call it that)_

- It's a tool, but it plays like a game
- Has a minimal user interface that can create (and edit) road networks with complex features in simple ways.
- With it's internal data structure modelled after OpenStreetMaps to simplify importing datasets (and potentially exporting to it).
- Open source from day ~~1~~ 13th.
